# Success_v_hardwork
Short script to determine the importance of luck in a person's success. 
A population of 20,000 was created, each person was then assigned a score out of 100 for intellect, knowledge and skill.
These scores were then combined to give a total score out of 300. 
The top 10 candidates were then located. 
Each person was then given a random score out of 100 for luck.
Each candidates score for skill, knowledge and intellect (total 90% weighting) were then combined with their respective luck score (total 105 weighting).
The top 10 candidates when just intellect, skill and knowledge were factors were then compared to th top 10 candidates when luck was factored in.
